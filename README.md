# Akeno-uWS
This repository is for the fork of µWebSockets used by [Akeno](https://github.com/the-lstv/akeno).
It includes a custom router and some other modifications.

Please see [Akeno](https://github.com/the-lstv/akeno), or [Akeno uWS.js](https://github.com/the-lstv/akeno-uws-js) if you are looking for the other part of this uWebSockets fork.
Due to how it's structured, Akeno is split into three repositories, the main (akeno), then the two forks of uWebSockets repositories (uWebSockets and uWebSockets.js). This repository is for the C++ part of the uWebSockets fork.

> [!NOTE]
> All issues/PRs should go to the [main Akeno repository](https://github.com/the-lstv/akeno).
